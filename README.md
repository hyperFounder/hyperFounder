# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a member of the [Computer Science Society](https://cssbham.com/) at the University of Birmingham.

My interests in Theoretical Machine Learning include

- validity criteria for partitional and hierarchial algorithms (silhouette coefficient, cophenetic correlation, etc.)
- Metaheuristics and local search (2-opt, Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm)
- optimization algorithms (hill climbing, simulated annealing, gradient descent)
- Unsupervised Learning
- randomized algorithms (monte carlo, quicksort, las vegas)
